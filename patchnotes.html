                        <p class="patch-description"> Here comes patch 25.08! Bringing some balance changes across all the currently active queues. This is also the last patch of the current Ranked Season so make sure to get your 15 wins to lock in Victorious Twisted Fate!
                            This patch sees improvements to some items that have fallen out of the spotlight like Cryptbloom, Opportunity and Overlord's Bloodmail. As well as Mel and Zoe coming back into the meta after being out of it for a while.
                            We're also shipping some larger work to Annie to make her a bit more satisfying by moving damage out of Tibbers' sustained damage that can be hard to feel, and into her spellcasts. For Ahri and Syndra, we feel like their builds are a little off; Ahri is building more tanky than we'd like and Syndra is able to opt too easily into lower damage purchases and still be very effective, so we're tweaking that a little. Other changes include follow-up balance to champions we've done larger work on recently like Gwen and Yorick.</p>
